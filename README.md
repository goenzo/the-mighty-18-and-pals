# The Mighty 18 and Pals

It was the year 2025 where it was a safe and peaceful world called Ethereum. The people who lived in this world could build anything because Ethereum was a world that you built on.  Since no one owned it, it was free to build on it. But there were villains that used the technology to steal things or cause chaos. 

One day, there was a jewelry store selling really expensive diamonds and other precious jewels. It happened on a normal day around lunch time. Four robbers broke into the store using a machine that can break through walls and can get things from long distances. The machine was like a box that had long mechanical arms and a drill. The staff and customers screamed and ran away. The robbers made an evil grin and took the diamonds with their machine.

A deep, clear voice said, “Not so fast, fools.” The robbers looked up and saw the mighty 18 super heroes, each with unique powers. 

“There’s the mighty 18!” said a young boy. People around the store started cheering. The robbers tried to make a run for it, but something bumped into the robbers; it was Rootstock.

One of the robbers tried to tackle Rootstock, but Rootstock slid through the robber's arms using his flexibility. 

Friendship hero, ENS, ran to the robber and started talking to him. In less than 10 seconds, they became best friends and gave back the jewels that he stole. 

The other three robbers tried to run away, but four hero’s appeared ahead of them. It was speed hero Saga, teamwork hero Curvegrid, magic hero Flow, and innovation hero 1 inch. 

Curvegrid told what the heroes should do to capture the robbers and shouted, “Attack!”. 

First, Flow shouted the fire spell. The robbers caught on fire.

Then, as the robbers flung their jewels out of their hand, speed hero Saga caught the jewels in midair. 

Innovation hero, 1inch, made a rope that cannot be untied. 1inch flung it around the robbers. 

From a distance, sirens sounded and three police cars came crashing down the street. The five superheroes gave the robbers to the police. The crowd started cheering and the five heroes returned to their home base, ETHGlobal.

In the city of Ethereum, there was a tropical garden called ETHGlobal at the center of the city. This tropical garden, lush with palm trees, hibiscus and passion fruit trees, was covered with an invisible protective dome.

Heroes came in and out of it. There were rumors something was being created inside of it.

The rest of the Mighty 18, the superheroes, were waiting inside. As the five heroes returned from combatting the robbers, a screen suspended from the ceiling slowly descended. Dr. Kartik with his usual calm expression spoke through the screen, 

“There has been a disaster. As you may know, Mauvais has been gaining power these past 5 years. About a month ago, Mauvais broke into our garden. Luckily, the Thing was not stolen because it was not in the garden. But this time, he has stolen it.”

The heroes gasped.

Saga, hero of speed said, “It’s still here.” 

“Yes, but by using his power, he faked and copied our Thing.”

”Hey, but wait. What are we talking about here?” Curvegrid asked. 

“Oh sorry, I forgot to explain that” said Dr.  Kartik. “So this Thing that I’m talking about is called ownership.” 

 “What now?” said Rootstock, the hero of flexibility. 

Dr. Kartik now said in a concerned tone, “For the past 2000 years, no one has ever owned Ethereum. By using this ownership, which is a card, you can own Ethereum. You can do terrible things by owning it. You can create things that are so powerful that it can destroy the world.”

The heroes were crying out words of concern. Some of them actually swore. Doctor Kartik cleared his throat and all the heroes went silent. 

“Today we are going to take the ownership back from him before anything bad happens. Mighty 18, assemble!!” shouted Dr. Kartik.

All of the heroes dashed out of the dome.

“But wait,” said the hero of humanity, World. “Do you guys even know where he is? The joke's too cold to be funny.”

Everyone paused. 

“According to my calculations,” said Nodit, the hero of data, “Mauvais is at the far west forgotten city, the Hackathon.” 

They all nodded and dashed to the forgotten city.

Meanwhile, at the forgotten city, there was a cloaked figure. He took his skull mask off, and it was Dr. Kartik.

The heroes headed to the city. There was a gate and guards in front of it. Permissionless heroes, Uniswap and Hyperlane, used their powers to get past the guards, without any permission. The heroes walked to the creepy town and saw a man with a black cloak, holding a card.

“Mauvais…” murmured the heroes. 

Bitcoin hero, Citrea, traded the guards with Bitcoin. He got a transceiver. He called the military to come as fast as they could to the Hackathon.

The heroes found Mauvais at the forgotten city, and saw him say something to the card. A giant snake appeared out of nowhere. It spat venom at the heroes. Suddenly, a huge shield appeared and the poison got deflected.  It was anti-virus hero, Zircuit.

The hero of simplicity yelled, “be aggressive!” to Hashkey Chain, the hero of compliance.

HashKey Chain started attacking the snake with his fist. The snake wailed in pain and fell to the ground. The other heroes cheered.

With a tone of anger in his voice, Mauvais quietly said, “Why do you stupid heroes always try to stop me? You should pay for what you did.” 

Mauvais then shouted, “explosion of zero!”

From the card, a huge explosion erupted. All the heroes got blasted and fell backwards. They all groaned in pain. But one hero was still standing. It was Polygon, the hero of relentlessness. 

“We can still do this! He may be really strong, but he is alone. We have a team effort and we can destroy him.”

Another hero stood up. Celo, hero of prosperity, said, “I will use all of the assets that I have to destroy you.”

There was a funny PayPay (a Japanese digital paying system) sound somewhere ahead. Out of nowhere, there was a card of ownership.

Celo yelled, “make the heroes hundred times stronger!” 

Polygon yelled, “do your best attack that you can think of! In the count of three, “one, two….” 

A giant crystal shot out of the card.
“Nooooo!” Mauvais whimpered as his mask slid off his face and stumbled to the floor. Mauvais fainted and lost consciousness. It was Dr. Kartik.

The heroes were so shocked that they couldn’t even say a word. A few heroes said, “We did the right thing to stop him and destroy the card.” 

Mauvais woke up and were surrounded by heroes and had an expression of both freight and tiredness. 

One of the hero’s asked, “why did you do this!”

Mauvais said, “I thought we needed a person that could control Ethereum and stop people from creating things because there was too much risk.”

 “Well” said the heroes all together, “being creative is all about taking risks and that’s why you can make such a good thing.” Mauvais had a defeated expression on his face. 

The heroes looked up. There was a rainbow in the sky, as if it was agreeing with what the heroes had just said.
